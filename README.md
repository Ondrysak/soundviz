# Soundviz

Audio-reactive visualizations built with Three.js and WebGL shaders.

## How to run

1. Open `threejs-visualizations/index.html` in a browser
2. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. Select a visualization from the dropdown
4. Adjust parameters using the GUI panel

Requires a modern browser with WebGL support and microphone permissions.

## What's included

20+ shader-based visualizations including:
- Shader effects (hexagon cells, plasma, vertex distortion)
- Particle systems (galaxy, rings, instanced grids)
- Fractals (Mandelbrot, orbifold folds)
- 3D geometry (deforming meshes, torus knots, ribbons)
- Post-processing effects (feedback, lens flares, spotlights)

All visualizations react to audio input in real-time.
